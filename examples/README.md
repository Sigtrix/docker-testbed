# Example test setups 
This directory has sample test setups and results which illustrate the 
features incorporated in the current testbed and results corresponding to 
the research work done using this testbed.

## Topologies
This directory contains configuration files of basic network topologies.
This can be helpful to learn how to write the configuration files in order to setup
the network using our testbed.
- Dumbbell
- Linear
- Ring
- Star

## Bottleneck Measurements
This directory contains experiments corresponding to two types of methods - using capacity and load - to determine bottleneck of a network with Pathneck.
- Capacity Determined Bottleneck
- Load Determined Bottleneck

## BW-Latency-Measurements
This directory contains an experiment that compares measurements of
bandwidth and latency with the user configured values.

## Gap-Measurements
This directory contains an experiment that gives gap values measured
by Pathneck as well as the determined bottleneck.
